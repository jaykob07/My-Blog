# Blog Built with Django

Welcome to my blog built with Django, HTML, CSS, and SQLite3. This project is a platform where I share my thoughts, experiences, and knowledge.

## Features

- **Django:** I use the Django web framework to build the backend of my blog. Django provides a robust and scalable structure for handling server-side logic.

- **HTML and CSS:** The frontend of my blog is developed using HTML for structure and CSS for styling. This ensures an attractive and responsive user interface.

- **SQLite3:** The SQLite3 database is used to store and manage the blog data. SQLite3 is a lightweight and easy-to-set-up database, perfect for small to medium-sized projects.
